•
Delays due to customer struggles to 
generate test data.
•
Some Payers do not have strong resources 
to know how to test or generate use cases.
•
Customers must pass Questionnaires to 
multiple internal department contacts 
causing delays.
•
Questionnaires retuned with missing data or 
based on responses we need additional 
data.
•
Ensuring the most recent questionnaire 
version is used.
•
Inability to test GSD tickets that impact 
EPDM prior to pushing to production.
•
Delays and defects related to internal 
dependencies such as Data Power and 
Security teams.
•
Inconsistent template standards across 
products. Some products can enhance 
outbound PID and some cannot.
•
Some product templates do not support 
the implementation delivery process. Ex. 
Some products can be delivered by region 
and some cannot.
•
Need the ability to copy a prior 
configuration to a new PID for a customer.
•
Customers implemented prior to 
configuration template are not in the tool 
to enable maintenance updates.
•
Lack of ownership for product templates 
once they are in the EPDM tool.
•
Lack of product documentation 
consistency.
•
Complexity of configurations growing with 
varying nomenclature and technical terms.
•
Inconsistent ability to validate varies 
greatly.
•
Significant defects persist. Ex. Pushing to 
environment doesn’t always push. 
•
No Standards or tool guidelines.
•
No version history or change log.
•
No confirmation of changes made or 
warnings if they didn’t save.
•
No confirmation of environment 
promotions or warning if they don’t push 
properly.
•
Logos require development work.
•
Basic setups require a lot of clicks.
•
Manual, error prone process.
•
Tool does not advise if a required field is 
missing or should not be editable.
•
No ability to search, filter, or export data
